one four twenty-four pseudocode

establish grid layout
    one verticle column of six dice in the middle of the screen
    two players, right and left
    two dice on top for each player, for the 1 and the 4
    three on next row, and two below
    maybe use ipad to animate six sides of a dice to rotate between the six then select one
    make sure an image of a dice is associated with its corresponding number 
dice images
    draw each die on iPad with imperfect edges
roll button
    create function to calculate random number between 1 and 6
    for each of the six dice, image associated with number in array 
    on click, cycle through the six images for each dice
rules
    player must select at least one dice per turn, no maximum 
    maximum of six turns
    algorithm does not change for number of dice ie the dice run independent of one another or the past numbers rolled
selection
    dice move from middle column to players side on left or right 
    click moves die to position
scoring
    score runs continuously 
    maybe it would be easier to tabulate score at end and subtract 5 for the one and four
endgame
    if you dont get one or four error message auto loss but other player can still finish turn
    idea is that its a game between two players, but winner can stay in the game and face new challenger
    after all dice are selected move to next players turn
    after both turns, end game and higher score that qualified wins
